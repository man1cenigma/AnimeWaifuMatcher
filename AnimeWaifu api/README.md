## Customization

### Adding New Characters

```javascript
{
    name: "Character Name",
    anime: "Anime Series",
    description: "Character description...",
    image: "image_url_or_placeholder",
    traits: ["trait1", "trait2", "trait3"]
}
```

### Adding New Questions

To add new questions, edit the `questions` array in `script.js`:

```javascript
{
    question: "Your question here?",
    options: [
        { text: "Option 1", traits: ["trait1", "trait2"] },
        { text: "Option 2", traits: ["trait3", "trait4"] }
    ]
}
```

1. Modify the character objects to include API IDs
2. Add API calls to fetch real character images and data
3. Update the matching algorithm if needed
